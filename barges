Out of my window looking in the night,
I can see the barges flickering light.
Silently flows the river to the sea,
As the barges go by silently.

Chorus

Out of my window looking in the night,
I can see the barges flickering light.
Starboard shining green and port is shining red,
I can see the barges from my bed.

Chorus

Out of my window looking in the night,
I can see the barges flickering light.
Anchors start to pull and engines start to roar,
As the barges pull away from shore.

Chorus

Out of my window looking in the night,
I can see the barges flickering light.
Stars are brightly lighting up the sky,
As the barges seem to skip right by.

Chorus

Out of my window looking in the night
I can see the barges flickering light.
Taking their cargo out into the sea,
How I wish someday they'd take me.

Chorus

How my heart wants to sail away with you,
As you sail across the ocean blue.
But I must stay beside my window clear,
As the barges sail away from here.

Chorus
