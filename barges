Out of my window looking in the night,
I can see the barges flickering light.
Silently flows the river to the sea,
As the barges go by silently.

Barges, I would like to go with you, 
I would like to sail the ocean blue.
Barges, have you treasures in your hold?
Do you fight with priates brave and bold?


Out of my window looking in the night,
I can see the barges flickering light.
Starboard shining green and port is shining red,
I can see the barges from my bed.

Barges, I would like to go with you, 
I would like to sail the ocean blue.
Barges, have you treasures in your hold?
Do you fight with priates brave and bold?

Out of my window looking in the night,
I can see the barges flickering light.
Anchors start to pull and engines start to roar,
As the barges pull away from shore.

Barges, I would like to go with you, 
I would like to sail the ocean blue.
Barges, have you treasures in your hold?
Do you fight with priates brave and bold?

Out of my window looking in the night,
I can see the barges flickering light.
Stars are brightly lighting up the sky,
As the barges seem to skip right by.

Barges, I would like to go with you, 
I would like to sail the ocean blue.
Barges, have you treasures in your hold?
Do you fight with priates brave and bold?

Out of my window looking in the night
I can see the barges flickering light.
Taking their cargo out into the sea,
How I wish someday they'd take me.

Barges, I would like to go with you, 
I would like to sail the ocean blue.
Barges, have you treasures in your hold?
Do you fight with priates brave and bold?

(Song was never finished.  Hum main verse again)

Barges, I would like to go with you, 
I would like to sail the ocean blue.
Barges, have you treasures in your hold?
Do you fight with priates brave and bold?
